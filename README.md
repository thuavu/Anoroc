# Anoroc

This repo contains the video game project, Anoroc. 

## Summary
Anoroc is based on a post-apocalyptic world where the players are transported to an eerie room and forced to play the game against their will. Players have to maneuver around and find the right items to assist the other unseen player stuck with them. Throughout the journey, players will unravel more about the mysterious partner, lunatic kidnapper, and an unrecognizable world. The players move around the room and find any key items they need to escape the room. The players can send each other items that they need and communicate with each other so if one person gets stuck they can help each other out.
